# üìÑ Automated Resume PDF Generation & GitHub Release

This repository automates the process of **converting a JSON issue into a resume PDF**, creating a **GitHub Release**, and **sending a link to download the resume to the email provided in the JSON**.

---

## üöÄ **How It Works**

1. **Open a new GitHub Issue** and paste your resume data in **JSON format**.
2. **GitHub Actions automatically converts** the JSON into a `resume.pdf`.
3. **A unique timestamp-based tag is created**.
4. **The PDF is uploaded to a GitHub Release**.
5. **A link to download the resume is sent to the email provided in the JSON**.

---

## üõ† **GitHub Actions Workflow Overview**

This workflow triggers when **a new issue is opened**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Creation & JSON Parsing**
- When a **new issue** is opened, its **content is extracted**.
- The JSON is **saved as `resume.json`**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert JSON to PDF**
- The **`resume.json`** is processed using a script that generates a **formatted PDF**.
- The PDF is saved as `resume.pdf`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Unique Tag & Create a GitHub Release**
- A **unique timestamp-based tag** (`release-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`) is created.
- The **`resume.pdf`** is uploaded to a GitHub Release.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Send Resume Download Link via Email**
- The email provided in the JSON is extracted.
- A **download link for the resume PDF** is sent to that email automatically.
